The torn-up panelling, which was first released as a collection, has become popular in recent years. The pre-distressed sneaker has been updated with some technical elements taken from New Balance's outdoor collection. Though the excitement surrounding sneakers receiving the protection pack treatment has subsided recently, there's no doubt that the 2002R looks best when the panelling is ragged. </h1>

The striking contrast between bright yellow and deep black appears just as sleek today as it did when it was first introduced back in 2006, and the high-quality nubuck used on the uppers lends the entire ensemble an incredibly opulent vibe.</h1>
